        <p>Hi everyone! My name is Axel! I'm a Venezuelan boy that is currently living in Curitiba, Brazil. I love all
            kinds
            of arts; from classic paintings, music, movies and videogames. I seek to grow as a person every day, and it
            is
            in my best interests to improve as much as I can in this web development course! </p>
